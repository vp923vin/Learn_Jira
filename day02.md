Que.1 - Explain the workflow of Jira.

Ans. Since Jira is used to track the issue and transitions in the development life cycle of the software, 
    the workflow is like a set of software-related activities which help in performing these operations. 
    The link between these 2 states is called a transition. The issue moves from one transition state to another state. 
    The status is used to define the nature of the work that is completed by the tester.
